This leaderhead is an imported model from Poser. The body is the lowpoly version of the Alyson model, the clothes are based on the DE731Jacket by DarkEdgeDesign and the MahinaLightArmor by Awfulsoul. Therefore, while many modifications of the models and artwork were made by me, I take no credit for the 3D model.

This leaderhead uses the Pericles animations. It's completely modular. All files in the zip-file are already put into the necessary folders, unzipping it directly in the Mods folder of BtS should result into a working mod. The leaderhead has a polycount of about 12900 triangles. 

Because there is no Amazonian civilisation she is an additional leader for the Persians. Her traits are imperalistic & protective.
